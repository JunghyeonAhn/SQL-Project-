# ðŸ›’Online Retail Transaction Analysis
In this project, I analyzed a shopping trends dataset using **MySQL** in the **DBeaver environment**.  

The analysis covers the entire workflow:
- **Data Cleaning**: handling missing values, wrong product name, and product Name standardisation and categorisation  
- **Product-Centric Analysis**: 
- **Time Series Analysis**:
- **Actionable Insights**: 

This work demonstrates my ability to use SQL for **discovering consumer purchase insights through retail data analysis**, from raw data exploration to generating insights that can inform marketing and product decisions.

## Project 1: Cleaning the data

### 1. Preview the data
Before cleaning the data, check the row count.<br><br>

### 2.Numeric Outlier Value
Firstly, I examine the distribution of Price and Quantity using the Min, Median, and Max values. The results indicate significant negative outliers in both the Price and Quantity columns.<br><br>
<img width="532" height="223" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e831a99-51cd-4e5b-a44b-2c0f06086470" />
<br><br>
The table contains 10,626 negative transactions, which accounts for 1.96% of the total dataset. <br><br>
<img width="290" height="148" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb4454b8-bbb6-4cec-881d-315a0f0d1553" />
<br><br>
Furthermore, some negative transactions contain empty strings in the 'Description' column (the item name).<br><br>
<img width="377" height="241" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9da656fd-9053-4eec-a3df-fd1494489a19" />
<br><br>
 The next step is to check all remaining missing values, including both NULLs and empty strings, across each column.<br><br>

### 3. Missing Values(NULL & Empty Strings)
An initial data quality check was performed to confirm the integrity of the dataset. The query below specifically verifies the presence of NULL values across all key columns. <br><br>
<img width="539" height="238" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8526de4e-4ef0-4181-89c0-02765fbdeb98" />
<br><br>
While the dataset contained no explicit NULL values, a proactive check for empty strings ('') was executed, as they can also indicate missing data. This analysis revealed a significant finding: 135,080 empty cells across the dataset. <br><br>
<img width="206" height="243" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/323dba5d-7f1d-4595-b81e-07280882d3e7" />
<br><br>
<img width="502" height="240" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3566882f-e31f-4678-a570-bdb0d60e8b97" />
<br><br>
To understand the exact distribution of missing data, I proceeded to aggregate the empty cell count for every column.<br><br> 
<img width="547" height="434" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e29bd06c-dde4-4d20-996f-b6a632a1f28a" />
<br><br>
As a result, customer ID colunn confirmed for all 135,080 missing datas. Seperately, 1454 duplicates in entries were also indentifued with the Descriotion column. 
However, missing data is **24.93%** of total records. With **24.93%** deletion is impractical. Instead, the non missing and smiliar data will be retained and analyzed by utilizing Invoice Column.<br><br> 

### 4. Date/Time Range and Format Validation
Through the InvoiceDate, this data shows that sold history between 01/10/2011 ~ 09/09/2011, 8 months. To time-series analysis, I will proceed by transforming the date data, extracting **year, month, and day** to simplify subsequent analyses. <br><br>
<img width="344" height="182" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d546f5b-5509-4f82-921b-0da477ceafc9" />
<br><br>

### 5. Product Description Noise Filtration
Descrpition column contains diverse outliers(eg. ? , damaged, cracked, sold, sample, display and etc).  I first confirmed that these entries constituted a minority of the records.The discovery process leveraged aggregation and sorting to quickly surface these infrequent patterns. <br><br>
<img width="283" height="461" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09519679-bc86-4902-92ba-6a2962b27993" />
<br><br>
I identified the outliers by utilising aggregation and descending sorting of the item counts. This process revealed that most unstandard values were infrequent, appearing only once or twice in the dataset. <br><br>
 01. Outliers in Description column. <br>
<img width="273" height="452" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/204083fd-58b6-47ea-8d95-98f9719f78ad" />
<br><br>
02. Outliers in Description column. <br>
<img width="280" height="275" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44f98fad-300c-4442-b9c9-b78f62966341" />
<br><br>
To effectively remove the noise, I identified and categorized several words that represented outlier values including sold, error, crack, rusty, etc.  <br><br>
<img width="650" height="635" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0841fa41-83e8-4ced-9546-8ee9fdab8095" />
<br><br>
After identifying and deleting the outliers, 2,166 rows were removed, leaving 539,743 rows from the original 541,909 for further analysis. <br><br>
<img width="283" height="353" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e10b3216-2172-4f54-930a-3cfdfae83dfb" />
<br><br>

### 6.Changing Date before analysing
<img width="764" height="264" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbbacdaa-04e4-4e24-83c0-28d54d322a1b" />
<br><br>
I created a VIEW about InvoiceDate column to make it easy to aggregate the data by months.  <br><br>
<img width="452" height="232" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d7eadc6-df15-458d-9416-5be6a4d9c8c9" />
<br><br>
Through these steps, I obtain a cleaner and more reliable dataset. <br><br>
